**Official Docker image for FLOWLY** - An open source project management platform with conversational AI for task execution in-app that lets you manage projects through natural conversation directly within the application.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Create docker-compose.yml (see below)
docker compose up -d

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

## What is FLOWLY?

FLOWLY is a self-hosted project management platform that combines traditional PM features with conversational AI for task execution in-app. The AI assistant performs actions directly in your browser through natural conversation. Instead of clicking through forms and menus, simply describe what you need in natural language.

**Key Features:**
- 🤖 Conversational AI for task execution in-app
- 💬 Natural language project management through in-app chat
- 🏠 Self-hosted - your data stays with you
- 💰 Bring your own LLM API key
- 📊 Full PM suite: Kanban, sprints, dependencies, time tracking
- 🌐 Open Source (Business Source License)

## Supported Architectures

Multi-architecture images supporting:
- `linux/amd64` - x86-64 (Intel/AMD)
- `linux/arm64` - ARM 64-bit (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton)

Docker automatically pulls the correct architecture for your platform.

## Docker Compose Setup (Recommended)

openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Volumes

The image uses the following volumes:

- `/app/FLOWLY/uploads` - User uploaded files
- `/app/FLOWLY/logs` - Application logs

## Ports

- `3000` - Combined frontend and backend (Next.js serves both)

## Health Check

The image includes a health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Conversational AI Task Execution Setup

After starting FLOWLY, enable conversational AI for in-app task execution:

1. **Navigate to Settings** → Organization Settings → AI Assistant Settings
2. **Add your LLM API key** from any provider:
   - OpenRouter (100+ models): `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
   - OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
   - Anthropic: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1`
   - Local AI (Ollama): Your local endpoint
3. **Start using conversational AI in-app** - Open the AI chat panel and have natural conversations to execute tasks:
   - "Create sprint with high-priority bugs from last week"
   - "Set up Q1 marketing workspace with 3 projects"
   - "Move all overdue tasks to next sprint"

## Version Tags

- `latest` - Latest stable release
- `0.1.0` - Specific version
- `0.1.0-<git-sha>` - Version with git commit hash

## Production Deployment

### Security Checklist

- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Generate secure JWT secrets (32+ characters)
- [ ] Generate secure encryption key (64 hex characters)
- [ ] Use strong database password
- [ ] Use strong Redis password
- [ ] Set up HTTPS with reverse proxy (Nginx/Caddy)
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up regular database backups
- [ ] Enable Docker log rotation

### Reverse Proxy Example (Nginx)

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name FLOWLY.example.com;

    client_max_body_size 10M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

## Backup and Restore

### Backup

```bash
# Backup PostgreSQL
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U FLOWLY FLOWLY > backup.sql

# Backup uploads
docker compose cp app:/app/FLOWLY/uploads ./uploads_backup
```

### Restore

```bash
# Restore PostgreSQL
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U FLOWLY FLOWLY < backup.sql

# Restore uploads
docker compose cp ./uploads_backup app:/app/FLOWLY/uploads
```

## Troubleshooting

### Container won't start

```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs app

# Check health status
docker compose ps
```

### Database connection issues

```bash
# Verify PostgreSQL is healthy
docker compose ps postgres

# Test connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U FLOWLY -d FLOWLY -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Reset database

```bash
# Connect to container
docker compose exec app sh

# Run reset (WARNING: Deletes all data!)
npm run db:reset
```

### Port conflicts

If port 3000 is already in use, change the port mapping in docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:3000"  # Use port 8080 instead
```
